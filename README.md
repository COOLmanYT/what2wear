## Features

- **Multi-source weather** — aggregates data from OpenWeatherMap, Open-Meteo, and Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) for accuracy, with hourly forecasts
- **AI outfit recommendations** — uses OpenAI GPT-4o or Google Gemini to suggest what to wear
- **Follow-ups** — ask follow-up questions like "should I bring an umbrella?" or "what if I need formal shoes?"
- **Digital closet** — add your wardrobe items so the AI knows what you own
- **Bring Your Own Key** — Pro users can use their own AI API key (never stored)
- **Custom weather sources** — Pro users can add their own weather data sources
- **GPS & manual location** — use your browser's location or search for any city
- **Dark mode** — automatic, based on system preference

## Getting started

See **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for full deployment and local development instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in values in .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Security

- **SSRF protection** — custom weather source URLs are validated against private/internal hosts
- **HTTPS only** — custom source URLs must use HTTPS
- **No secrets in client** — all API keys are server-side only
- **BYOK keys are never stored** — user-provided AI API keys are used for the single request and discarded
- **Row Level Security** — Supabase RLS policies restrict data access to the owning user
- **JWT sessions** — NextAuth uses JWT strategy; the database adapter is wrapped in a safe fallback
- **Input validation** — coordinates, API inputs, and user content are validated before use
- **Rate limiting** — daily usage limits prevent abuse of AI and weather APIs
